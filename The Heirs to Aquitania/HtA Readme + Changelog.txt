The Heirs to Aquitania
A total conversion mod by Savs
Based on the HtA megacampaign

Features a new world with nearly 800 years of different history (mostly as determined by the computer in CK2 and EU3)
Development has been in fits and spurts since June 2014. The mod is based on /gsg/Vickymod v1.06, which was popular at that time. It is not based on PDM, nor on HPM/HFM.

**CHANGELOG**

Verison 0.37 - Poland and Italy

Major
- Added more content for Poland **************
- Added decisions and events for the Padan Union and Naples
	- Added a new tag - Meridion (MER) - as an intermediate step between Naples and Italy
- Added a new government type, the Provisional Government (which comes in yes_election and no_election forms according to whether elections are allowed, obviously) which is used for PDN initially and can be used for other countries in the future
	- Also added events to switch between them based on the vote franchise
- Added an Install Monarchy CB for great/secondary powers against democracies
- Pan-nationalist rebels will not rise if their cultural union doesn't exist - THIS MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED SO THAT ONLY GERMAN ONES WON'T RISE (because I'm OK with French ones, for example)
- Added an event for SML to lose control of its Black Sea provinces if it's at peace and neither UKR nor DON are its vassals/owned by it (the check is based on four major provinces in different states close to the land)
- Added a decision for RUS to break the truce and just go capture the city of Smolensk if they have basically no military. It costs more infamy, but has the same end result as the other two ways to end the conflict
- Improvements to Aenglisc-Albannach (and also AEN-IRE) war interactions, how Alba's colonies are handed out (still work to be done here to make it more dynamic) and the AI's ability to conclude the wars
- Decision for AI countries not to interfere in the Russian wars if both RUS and SML are AI. They will take the decision to leave the war if they are called in and accept it.
- Incorporated a new system for releasing vassals, with thanks to the Vic2 Modding server on Discord
- A lot of stuff by ChortlingGnome in North and South Ameriga:
	- Shawnee internal conflict and defensive wars against post-colonial countries
	- Decisions for the aforementioned countries to get cores on native land in NA
	- Vestland has the possibility to get a union with New Holland
	- WIP stuff with slave trade for MRG (will get finished in 0.52)
	- Gidan gets some interaction with MRG over the slave trade and some expansion decisions into the Caribbean and south to the Jordrasc/Amazon river
	- Mexika begins as a confederation with several native countries under it (will work on POPs in the region in 0.54 unless someone beats me to it)
	- Mexika civil war (or averting it), possible union with CLF
	- Mexika interaction with Yucatla and pushing further south
	- Form Mellomamerika as a puppet if you're a New World GP
- Rework of the Roman Empire start for a different, more believable and interesting story by Bismarkingit
	- Three exarchates on the European side of the border
	- A revamped civil war
	- Armenia and Naples may weigh in
	- Some other stuff in the area

Minor
- Severely nerfed the OP Gold Rush modifier - now gives an immigrant attract of only 100% instead of ten times that. This needs testing to see if it should be buffed up a bit. Maybe 300%
- Once again slightly reduced the MIL and CON effects of the Eyjafjallajokull eruption in 1837
- Reorganized African events files
- Some more starting generals - thanks to MajorMajor
- Many new flags - thanks to Athemos and Periares
- Netherlands' Integrate Wallonia decision now gives a core, too
- French decisions to accept Wallonians, Picards and Bretons will now cost 5% of their prestige instead of a piddly 1 or 2
- Forming the Scylfiga Woning now gives 30 prestige instead of 120% of what you had.
- Added the Prusai culture, Baltic-speaking remnants of the Old Prussians, to the Polish-Lithuanian border region, along with a country for it - Prusova (tag PRS)
- Added a tag for Istria (tag IST), a Cisalpine-run confederation of the various cities in the state of Istria, plus some drama for the owner (probably AUS) of it.
- Added Moravia (tag MRV) as a country. It's mostly there to prevent Czechs from assimilating after the Treaty of Szekesfehervar
- Added (army) unit files from HFM
- Changed some country colours: CYR, EGY, MGH, LUZ, LTS, CHI
- Changed some culture colours: Guaraní, Lutzan
- Also added related decisions and events for dealing with its cores and what happens if it becomes independent
- Used native names for the Nahua culture, thanks to Komodo
- Copied over a lot of stuff about cultural tech from HPM, mostly so that the choice modifiers are more complex and so that there isn't so much colonial migration from tech (+0.5 per level before, now ´+0.05)
- Made it so Brunswick doesn't have a core on Emden, meaning that they should be able to do the decision chain before Germany forms
- Added events to remove cores of minors for BRA, BRN, BAV and GER
- GER gets a core on SWI when taking the Helvetian Patrimony decision
- Brabant should no longer sell its islands in Oceania/Volturnia if it has colonized beyond them in the region (continent)
- Native nations in the New World can no longer take the decision called New Life in the New World
- Made gold rush events not fire until 1870 for uncives
- When Smolensk annexes Russia, they now have a decision to reduce POP MIL and CON by 4 to reduce rebels
- Improvements to how DON joins RUS against SML
- Gave Mali one military reform (two seemed a bit OP, but it's there still if you want to readd it yourself!)
- Fixed 99% of remaining mismatches between various map files. The Paracel Islands will continue not to exist as land for gameplay purposes (though if you look closely you can see their shadow)
- Also made a lot rivers fit province borders better - lots more to do still
- Split Pau off from the Basque province of Miarritze, added two flavour events about Our Lady of Lourdes to the owner
- Added a new province in Slovakia, Banska Stiavnica. It produces precious metals, being a famous silver mine
- Made requirements for taking the Intervene in Persia decision more clear to the player
- Increased Make Puppet CB to 10 max badboy (previously 7)
- Demand concession CB can now target colonial states/provinces of uncivs
- Demand Concession CB and Establish Protectorate CB no longer available against CHI, QIN, GXI, MCK
- Made CBs normally available between RUS and SML when railroading is off
- Both German Hegemony CBs should fire the Our Cores Returned event normally
- Added a special event-only Liberate Country CB to allow the liberation of Syria correctly
- Increased starting experience in national values, so now they are actually kind of useful. This change is also reflected in the demonstration modifiers which you can see in the decision
- Changed some 1840s revolutions modifiers (global_liberal_agitation, among others) about liberalism to be more in line with HPM, not that I think it'll make much of a difference for the militancy problem
- Made the National Assimilation event impossible to fire until 1870
- Improved the event which signals the end of BRB cores, made it specifically for NET (more, kind of), and added one for BRB
- Tweaked the event announcing the German Hegemony wars so that more countries can do it in case there are some really overzealous conquerors in MP
- Added decisions for an independent Greece to claim the rest of the state of Thessalonikos and (if jingoist) to claim Crete
- Added a decision for Greece to fight the Roman Empire in the civil war even if for some reason Anatole can't normally
- Greek party tweaks
- Study Room Meetings should disappear from all BOH-owned provinces after they defeat the revolution
- Added a decision for a resurgent Bohemia to lease Zadar again
- Added a decision (which the AI will never take) to return a leased Zadar to Croatia or Yugoslavia (the latter should only be seen if some other country creates YUG, not the Zadar owner, please report to Savs if this is not the case)
- Tweaked the Yugoslavia creation decision to take into account a leased Zadar - if you still have the province, you will give it to Zadar automatically.
- Arbenon (Albania) must now no longer be a vassal or must be vassal of the country in question in order to be absorbed into Yugoslavia (whether that country is a vassal or no)
- Bulgaria gets cores on the Black Sea coastal provinces it should have cores on when the Bulgarian Insurrection event fires
- Added an event to make Ardeal release Banat and Syrmia and lose cores on them if it does not own land connected to that area (as often happens)
- Added a decision to regain the abovementioned lands as cores of Ardeal
- Added and modified some of the NaturalDisaster events from vanilla
- Tried to fix the Stilhav Naval Base decision for HOY, wasn't very successful.
- Brought in the HND country file from HPM with some tweaks and also changed its colour to a kind of bright pink
- Removed GNG from files and all references to it
- Tweaked a few LRs, esp. giving all of central Ameriga 35 LR (instead of 30)
- Made uncolonized South Amerigan provinces have colonial = 2 in their files so that they will be colonial when annexed by CHL and ARG
- Tweaked a few RGOs in Aengland
- Pumped up some starting prestige for important European countries
- Many localizations tweaks and fixes
- Lots of new event and decision pictures
- Added some info decisions
- Added some debug decisions/events
- Added decisions to toggle on/off the Change Tech School decisions
- Copied some code from HPM for some LiberalRevolutions events
- There should be a small pull for POPs to migrate to countries which have a similar culture/language (Hispanians and Portuguese to Latin America, Scandinavians to Margaria and other such countries, etc.)
- Added a utility tag for future use, and to ensure that sphere/market stuff works properly for GP#1
- Lots of other small stuff not worth mentioning
- Added a blank province map (current to 0.36.27) for whatever you might want to use it for. Will update it if it changes
- Moved most unused event/decision pictures into separate folders (mostly for keeping better track of things)
