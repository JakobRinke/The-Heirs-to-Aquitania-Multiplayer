## Margaria Slave Revolt

Luckily, members of the local constabulary were nearby and helped the plantation owner to disarm and apprehend these criminals. During interrogation afterwards, they revealed that they have had contact with a community of free slaves living in the swamp, possibly established by abolitionists from Gidan. It seems this group is spreading their seditious gospel up and down the river, even to natives. While we are trying to track down their hideouts, they have an uncanny ability to fade away into the marshland, evading our pursuers at every turn.

That this enslaved population might one day break its chains and rise up in rebellion has always lurked as the greatest threat to our nation, and there are some thinkers in our country who believe that we should transition away from slavery in order to maintain national stability. Moreover, the Albesan ideology which led to our founding in 1762 advocates a monarchy where every man is equal before the law, an awkward contradiction that has always rested at the heart of our society. Yet until abolitionists can match the political power of Margaria's hereditary nobility, the entrenched plantation class most supportive of the status quo, they are unlikely to change the legality of slavery.

More concerningly however, it seems that these citizens had state support in their mission to rouse rebellion.

While there remain many wealthy plantation owners who will certainly fight to maintain the current laws, the national dialogue on slavery has begun to decisively shift against them. The government could use this opportunity to once again allow for a debate on slavery in parliament.

	desc = "EVTDESC51025" ## Since the arrival of Aquitànian settlers on the coast of Mexika in the early 1700s, our people have always existed in a tenuous balance with the Nahua and Tarascan peoples. Although Aquitànian technology proved sufficient to overcome the Kingdom of Tlaxcala in 1742, the 30 years of colonization prior to independence from the Melgueil crown was insufficient to replace preexisting power structures with new ones from Europe. Thus, while the original Mexican constitution proposed a President elected by all land-owning citizens in the colony, President Guilhelm Fabres dissolved parliament in 1778 to preserve stability in the face of revolts by the Nahua, Tarascan and Zapotec peoples. However, increasing numbers of liberals and natives inspired by European Albesans are now demanding that the original Constitution be reinstated.

Away from our rule of law, these farmers are subject to harassment and land seizures by the still dominant indigenous peoples. In many parts of the confederations, they have formed 'Fòrça Defensa Personala' or 'Self-Defense Forces' to protect themselves from the natives. The fact that these forces exist is an awkward point of conflict between our government and the confederations, who have increasingly begun to demand that we condemn these extrajudicial groups. Doing so would certainly calm relations between us and the confederations, but would be seen as a betrayal by our own people.

The laws of our realm are unclear in this situation, and it is likely that we can force the two confederacies to stay divided if we so choose, but doing so might anger the Oaxacan monarchy. On the other hand, a more powerful Oaxaca might be a bigger threat to our rule.

Over the past decades, the confederations have slowly weakened in the face of an increasingly modern and industrializing Mexika. It seems that in light of the President's efforts to centralize the government, the Nahua indigenous peoples have finally revolted,  plunging all of Mexika into a civil war. Some observers regard this outcome as an inevitable outcome for the nation's multiethnic country, while others see it as a disappointing end to what have often been genuine attempts at compromise by both sides. The only thing that is certain now is that Mexika's future will be written only by its indigenous people, or its colonizers. The two cannot coexist.
