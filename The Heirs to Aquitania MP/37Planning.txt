Planning and ideas for 0.37

Poland:
- Something with the Sejm
	- Liberum veto never crippled Poland like it did OTL (think of some history, do some research)
	- If there's an elective monarchy, foreign king possible?
	- Consider adding a reform group: Power of the Nobility
		- Possible alternative: 
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executionist_movement
- Flavour events
- Black sea stuff?
- Oppose GER formation?
- Pressure BYZ to form Romania/Volasea, either as an independent or by attacking Ardeal to make a vassal Volasea?
- Ruthenians?
- Make sure that claims are not wonky

- Break Słupsk up from Köslin?

- Homeland for the Jews in the region? - Not sure how much this makes sense, though
	- Some country declares itself protector?
	- Balfour declaration type which presents options?
	
- If BOH gets some Polish land before the Treaty of Szekes, Hungary gets it + a core. Make an event for Poland and Hungary to negotiate about it.

Italy:

#- Rework NPL->ITA. Perhaps some sort of Mezzogiorno-like country ---- Meridional Kingdom
- Italy as a formable for the whole peninsula but only under specific circumstances and before a certain time:
	- NPL falling to Albesan rebels gives a temporary CB to conquer Italy and then form it? (MajorMajor)
	- PDN breakup gives NPL an opportunity to unite the peninsula
	- Consider also the ability of ITA to accept Cisalpine
	- ITA reverts to NPL if they hold neither Rome nor Reggio?
		- Same for dismantlement - it's one or the other
	- (Alternatively?): Sicilian nationalism grows and a joint kingdom is reformed a la BHN
- PDN-NPL war with each seeking allies
	- GP on PDN's side declares war on NPL with some wargoal and peaces out by decision when PDN's war ends.
		- Problem: NPL allies might agree to fight PDN, but not the GP
		- Problem: the occupations of the two separate wars would not count together
- When NPL's European holdings are taken by BYZ, make some event to make their holdings revert to someone (roman_italians decision)
	- Also see what changes need to be made to the relevant decisions in Hta_RomanEmpire in general
	- Check the form_italy_without decision in NationalUnification
	- Make sure there aren't pan-nationalist rebels or something
#- PDN civil war between monarchists and republicans --> the finishing of the provisional government chain
#- Deal with the ITAFlavor event and decision files
#- Sicily and the education stuff
#	- Choosing local language leads to Sicilian accepted
#	- Choosing Neapolitan grants an assimilation bonus to Sicilian provinces --> But why do that when you could just get Sicilian accepted and be done with it?
#		- Because SCL cores get removed!
#-Sicilian party names
-Follow-on for the event where you get a Conquest CB on Corsica-Sardinia?
		
Other: (probably actually for the 0.4 update)
- Figure out how crazy and stuff the AQT modifiers are. Uncle Sam keeps complaining about there being way too much CON and MIL growth ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤
- Does Greece sometimes WP in the RCW, as was reported on the forum?



	This is some other stuff that might not be so necessary
- Keep refining the Outremer and Near East files (like there was that one player who had a truce with Persia but wasn't involved in the war, but still got stuff)
- Make the crisis stopping event work even more. Event 60168 in crises.txt
- Remove/rework SGF formation (esp. localization)
	- Also fix GER formation and dismantlement. Weird stuff like Old Croatia sticking with Germany, cores remaining on BOH land even after it regains the provinces -- BOH given a new_bohemia flag when it reforms, use that to trigger the loss of non-BOH cores
		- GER gets vanilla-type cores, EWWW
- Add some decisions for Qin/Nanyue as detailed here https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-heirs-to-aquitania-altervicky-mod.895808/page-54#post-27043143
	- QIN/GXI suffers from the situation where GXI must be ahead of you in westernisation as QIN, but that doesn't happen because reactionary rebels. See what GeneralTownes wrote on Discord
- France eats Wallonia?
- Wallonian pre-emptive action against France?
- Stuff from this post: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-34#post-22477778 --- Mostly done, need to double check that the fix for the NET-NAL war WAD
	Should there be a better justification for Wallonia and its being integrated into the Greater Netherlands
- Hispania and Navarra from this post: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-34#post-22485910
- Doublecheck that Alba colonies in Indonesia go to all countries correctly
- To get an alliance, you should need a minimum 50 relationship with the target country - Why isn't this working?
- Make hills work
- Perhaps have some European response to the end of the RUS-SML conflict - big threat in the east!
	- Finnish intervention during the Russia war? Roman?
- Make some stuff for PER to give up its treaty ports even when it peacefully gives up JER
	- Crash when winning the war with PER as BYZ and releasing Syria via the Intervene in the Middle East decision
- A way for Roman Empire to get Trebizond, perhaps something eventy in tandem with ARM moving its capital to the east
- Consider revamping some AEN decisions, esp. wrt IRE
- Add some negative modifier for feudal (European) countries?
- MAKE SURE THAT NPL COLONIAL HOLDINGS MATCH LORE
- Look into the Free Latvia CB and who can use it
- Add the Demand Reparation CB from HPM
- Make a special CB for the Hungary-BOH war so that there can be a kind of white peace-type outcome for BOH
	- Also find a way for Saxony to not be annoying
- Make it so that Bohemian separatists after the peace of szekes don't last forever	
- Uncivs should not get the First Minister event stuff
- GNC stays at war forever with CLF for some reason? One reddit user reported that, and because of it they couldn't complete the event chain as SKM with GNC
- Make some way for BOH to avoid the Partition War
- Give some more checks to GNC-CLF-SKM interactions so one of the Aenglisc countries being a GP and sphereing/friendlying CLF will make it not happen at all
- Go through the modifiers and clean them up, esp. the HtA ones that are apparently never used
- Mediterranean blob events for absorbing cores from spherelings
	- Infamy, event chains, possible war, coalitions
- Make uncivs able to mobilize?
- Model colony should only fire after a certain date
- A POP migration modifier that brings primary POP farmers/labourers to new world provinces where there are none - to help with assimilation
- Go back and check the religious map at the end of EU3 to inform religious things in Vic2
